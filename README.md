Orientation is one way we describe how a body is
rotated in space and is necessary to describe the pose of an aerial vehicle or mobile robot. Orientation can be described in a variety of
ways including Euler angles, Axis-Angle, and quaternions.
These orientations can be estimated with the help of sensors
like an IMU which measures angular velocity and linear
acceleration. These sensors produce measurements that
trajectories which we can further refine with the help of
algorithms like gradient descent. Gradient descent is a
universal method for finding the local minimum. In this project,
I introduce a method to estimate and optimize a trajectory
using angular velocity and linear acceleration measurements from an IMU.
